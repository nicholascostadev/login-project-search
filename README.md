## How to run

```sh
# install dependencies
pnpm install

# build the application
pnpm build

# start the server
pnpm start
```

## Login

To login, please use these credentials:

username: "admin"
password: "password123"

Since we're not using a back-end, the authentication is simply saved as plane text on the localStorage

## Text editing

Since we're not using a back-end, the changes made inside the editor are not saved.
